# Activitiy-Detection
Due to the increasing number of elderly people and single households living alone,widespread deployment of sensors has become prominent in home environments for (1) detecting medical emergencies and (2) assessing behavioral changes. In such smarthomes, living spaces and objects used for daily activities are instrumented with passive sensors. 
* Many real-world applications that focus on addressing the needs of a human,require information about the activities being performed by the human in real-time, e.g. -
  * assist in addressing the problem of elderly care, 
  * young infants, and patients requiring
  * post operative care. 
* Prior works mention that completion of certain Activities of Daily Living(ADL) such as ***cooking, eating, daily hygiene*** are reliable indicators of the health of a person.

* In this project we try to solve this problem via an *unsupervised approach*.
